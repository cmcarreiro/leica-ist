## 2nd Year - 2nd Semester

### 1st Project - Grades Predictor
- Language: C
- Goal: build a grades predictor, given some heuristics
- [Project Statement](./grades-predictor/project-statement.pdf)
- [Solution](./grades-predictor/grades-predictor.c)
- [Report](./grades-predictor/grades-predictor-report.pdf)
- The solution to this problem involved coding a modified depth-first search algorithm

### 2nd Project - Citizens and Supermarkets
- Language: C++
- Goal: make a system that allows citizens to go to the supermarket without crossing each other
- [Project Statement](./citizens-supermarkets/project-statement.pdf)
- [Solution](./citizens-supermarkets/citizens-supermarkets.cpp)
- [Report](./citizens-supermarkets/citizens-supermarkets-report.pdf)
- By modelling the problem as a prison escape problem, we then used an Edmonds-Karp algorithm to solve the project.
